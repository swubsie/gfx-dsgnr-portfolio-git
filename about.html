            <p>I'm a creative genie by nature and curious at heart. A digital octopus that can do a little of it all. I have expertise in both digital and print. Primary in a creative marketing or media department focusing on brand activation and web development.</p>

            <p>I've been in roles like creative lead, agile coach, producer and project manager for the last six years, subsequently to my freelance autodidact design career. I'm adept in agile leadership, product development, marketing and media production.</p>

            <p>Honesty, empathy and healthy environments will always be my highest priority in leadership and its areas of responsibility. How I practise leadership is influenced by a people-first approach and philosophy.</p>

            <p>While at work, you will often find me busy with timely initiatives and solutions. It will usually be tasks and projects that may have the potential to optimise, improve or solve something for colleagues, clients or the organisation. I achieve this by collaborating and including values, vision, strategy and the opinions and ideas of the people around me.</p>

            <p>Former colleagues have said that I am good in teams. A careful and precise communicator who usually asks difficult but important questions from an objective and diplomatic point of view. Finally, I am an analytical, independent, logical, open, organised, and tolerant employee.</p>
